## ByteAcademy - Personalized Applied learning

### Personalized
We believe every student learns differently and value above all else - ensuring we understand and weaponize these differences. We do this in two ways.
* Daily 1on1s - We ensure every student has 1on1 meetings with teaching staff on a daily basis to communicate concerns early on
* Personal AI Tutor - Aiza is our AI that will closely monitor everything you submit at Byte to provide customized content tailored for you

### Applied
As fun and interesting theory is, our goal at Byte is to get people jobs. Therefore after understanding how you learn, our focus is teaching the knowledge most relevant in the industry today. We do this in two ways.
* Real-World Projects - We ensure every project you are tasked with is an open problem that publically exists and most employers will know about
* Real-World Experience - Spryte is our internship wing where, upon graduation - you will have an opportunity to gain the critical real-world experience you need for your first job 

## Aiza- Personal AI Tutor
Meet Aiza - your personal AI tutor. As you progress through the course, Aiza closely monitors your assessments, exercises alongside asking you what topics you think you're strong and weak at. It uses this information to design a customized learning experience to help strengthen the exact areas you are weak at!

Alongside helping customize our content for you, Aiza will also make your teaching staff aware of any technical shortcomings that may be present. So if you're ever lost and don't know how to ask for help, don't worry - we'll come to you.

## Spryte - Applied Experience
Spryte is where you actualize your knowledge on real world projects. Upon graduation we provide you with an opportunity to be apart of a development team tasked with building software for external companies. This will allow you to gain hands-on experience with the non-academic side of software including developing with a team and setting projections/deadlines. 

# Data Science Page
## Home Section
Data Science is a discipline concerned with finding meaningful patterns in complex data. Data is everywhere today and most companies are hungry to find patterns in the data. Whether it's determining how a stock price will change or finding the relationship between diapers and crib sales to determine buying patterns in mothers, the applications are endless.

The goal of this program is to teach you the theoretical ideas to exact meaningful patterns, as well as the applied coding skills to turn this theory into practice. The program is intense but produces quality data scientists able to get jobs at most major companies.

## Program Structure
* The week to week structure should be outlined in a visual as shown [here](https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/Curriculum-Development-Milestones/blob/master/Website-Pages/visual1.png) and [here](https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/Curriculum-Development-Milestones/blob/master/Website-Pages/visual2.png)

### Contents
* Weeks 1-5 - Computer Science Fundamentals
Students should be fully comfortable with the Python programming language after completion of this phase. This ranges from understanding the built-in syntax and semantics to leveraging powerful libraries to build complex applications designed to solve a broad range of problems. Students should also have an introductory understanding to most domains within software engineering including data structures, networking, databases and more.
* Weeks 6-10 - Machine Learning
This phase deals with understanding the fundamentals machine learning. Upon successful completion of this phase, students are expected to be able to develop machine learning models for various applications and be able to analyze them through technical factors such as over/underfitting. Models covered include regerssion, k-nearest neighbors, principal component analysis and most importantly neural networks.
* Weeks 11-14 - Large-Scale Project
Students will simulate a real-world environment and work on a large-scale project in a field they are interested in. Successful completion of this phase will result in developing a complete machine learning model on an application with some real world use cases.

### Day-To-Day
Each day will consist of 7 hours divided into 4 sections. We begin each day with a 1.5hour lecture from 10AM-11:30AM followed by half an hour of a Q&A session with the instructor. Following a 1hour lunch at 12:00PM, students are given 3.5hours to work on exercises for the material covered. The day ends with a 1 hour of help split between 1on1 tutoring and group studies. The day officially ends at 5:00PM but students are allowed to stay late to finish exercises or get a head-start on the next days material.

## Careers
Jobs within the field of data science typically pay quite well. An average entry-level data scientist is expected to earn approximately $75,0000/year ranging from $65,000 to $110,000. Jobs you will be qualified for upon successful completion of the program are as follows:
* Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer
  * Jobs with this title typically involve the whole domain of data science. You will be working on extracting data, analyzing this data for meaningful relationships as well as visualizing this data for non-technical staff.
* Backend Developer/Data Management Engineer
  * Jobs with this title typically focus on the earlier stages of machine learning. As the company gets larger and data grows exponentially, it becomes unrealistic for one person to do all work a data scientist does. This role focuses on collecting data, aggregating data and design considerations on how to store this data most efficiently. 

Job titles differ drastically from company to company so the above two categories encompass a host of job titles, the ones listed are simply the most common.
