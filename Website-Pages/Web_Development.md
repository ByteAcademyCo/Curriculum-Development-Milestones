## ByteAcademy - Personalized Applied learning

### Personalized
We believe every student learns differently and value above all else - ensuring we understand and weaponize these differences. We do this in two ways.
* Daily 1on1s - We ensure every student has 1on1 meetings with teaching staff on a daily basis to communicate concerns early on
* Personal AI Tutor - Aiza is our AI that will closely monitor everything you submit at Byte to provide customized content tailored for you

### Applied
As fun and interesting theory is, our goal at Byte is to get people jobs. Therefore after understanding how you learn, our focus is teaching the knowledge most relevant in the industry today. We do this in two ways.
* Real-World Projects - We ensure every project you are tasked with is an open problem that publically exists and most employers will know about
* Real-World Experience - Spryte is our internship wing where, upon graduation - you will have an opportunity to gain the critical real-world experience you need for your first job 

## Aiza- Personal AI Tutor
Meet Aiza - your personal AI tutor. As you progress through the course, Aiza closely monitors your assessments, exercises alongside asking you what topics you think you're strong and weak at. It uses this information to design a customized learning experience to help strengthen the exact areas you are weak at!

Alongside helping customize our content for you, Aiza will also make your teaching staff aware of any technical shortcomings that may be present. So if you're ever lost and don't know how to ask for help, don't worry - we'll come to you.

## Spryte - Applied Experience
Spryte is where you actualize your knowledge on real world projects. Upon graduation we provide you with an opportunity to be apart of a development team tasked with building software for external companies. This will allow you to gain hands-on experience with the non-academic side of software including developing with a team and setting projections/deadlines. 

# Web Development Page
## Home Section
Software Engineering is a discipline concerned with the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of computer software. Nearly everything in modern society has some underlying software component, and most businesses and services are now web-based. Whether it's your bank, social media, favorite communication platform, or food delivery, life now revolves around web-based applications and infrastructure.

The goal of this program is to teach you the theoretical basics of computer science, and give you the skills to apply those concepts to the construction of modern web applications using cutting-edge technologies. This program will give you the skills to work on both the client-side and server-side parts of a web application.

## Program Economics
The cost of our in-person and online program are $15,000 and $7,500 respectively. The programs are structured exactly the same, the only difference between them is whether the material is covered is online or in-person. There is evidence that in-person learning yields greater results than online due to the quality of live support and general motivation hence the discrepancy in the costs, even with the same program.

## Program Structure
* The week to week structure should be outlined in a visual as shown [here](https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/Curriculum-Development-Milestones/blob/master/Website-Pages/visual1.png) and [here](https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/Curriculum-Development-Milestones/blob/master/Website-Pages/visual2.png)

### Contents
* Weeks 1-5 - Computer Science Fundamentals
Students should be fully comfortable with the Python programming language after completion of this phase. This ranges from understanding the built-in syntax and semantics to leveraging powerful libraries to build complex applications designed to solve a broad range of problems. Students should also have an introductory understanding to most domains within software engineering including data structures, networking, databases and more.
* Weeks 6-10 - Web Development
This phase deals with understanding the fundamentals of web application development. Upon successful completion of this phase, students are expected to be able to develop a full end-to-end application, with the ability to store data in a SQL satabase, use a Python web server backend to handle incoming HTTP requests, acquire data from external sources, and present the user with a front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Topics covered include HTML, CSS, web servers & the Flask framework for Python, JavaScript fundamentals & syntax, and the React.js front-end framework.
* Weeks 11-14 - Sprint-Based Development
Students will simulate a real-world environment through participation in two group projects, using an Aglie development model. These projects will be executed in two successive two-week sprints, and will be assigned to groups of students by their instructor. Successful completion of this phase will result in developing two full stack applications, though each individual student may not work on all features of each application.

### Day-To-Day
Each day will consist of 7 hours divided into 4 sections. We begin each day with a 1.5hour lecture from 10AM-11:30AM followed by half an hour of a Q&A session with the instructor. Following a 1hour lunch at 12:00PM, students are given 3.5hours to work on exercises for the material covered. The day ends with a 1 hour of help split between 1on1 tutoring and group studies. The day officially ends at 5:00PM but students are allowed to stay late to finish exercises or get a head-start on the next days material.

## Careers
Jobs within the field of software engineering can vary greatly, but typically pay quite well. An average entry-level software developer is expected to earn approximately $67,0000/year, ranging from $55,000 to $95,000 (according to Glassdoor). Jobs you will be qualified for upon successful completion of the program are as follows:
* Software Engineer
  * Software Engineer job duties can vary greatly, depending on the size of the company and the code base in question. You will generally be working on project design, implementation, testing, and fixing client issues. These jobs can be specific to backend development or frontend development, or require a generalist who can work on both parts of a code base.
* Software Test Engineer
  * Jobs with this title typically focus on writing the tests that ensure production code works as designed and intended, to reduce and prevent. As companies get large, it becomes unrealistic for one person to do all the work while developing code, and test-specific engineers fill an important role in quality assurance. This role works with the company's more general software engineers and the quality assurance and DevOps teams to help keep code up to standard. 
  
Job titles differ drastically from company to company so the above categories encompass a host of job titles, the ones listed are simply some of the most common.
