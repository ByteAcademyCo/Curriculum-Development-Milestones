# Mass Expansion Strategy

**Rather than only marketing online, market in-person program in most in-demand cities**

* If we are indeed marketing US wide - waste of resources to only market online

## Strategy Implementation

1. Market in-person in the most in-demand cities we are advertising in
2. Advertise start date 2 months out for program
3. Start licensing procedures
4. If licensing takes longer than 2 months, change start date for that city to match
5. Can guage interest and if there is enough - open location
6. Steps to dynamically open low-cost locations [here](...)
